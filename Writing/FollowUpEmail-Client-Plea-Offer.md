**Example Email**

Dear \[client name\],

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the
prosecution's plea offer in your case. I wanted to provide you with this
written summary of our discussion for your records and to ensure you
have all the information necessary to make an informed decision about
how to proceed.

**Case Overview**

You are charged with Driving Under the Influence with Two Priors, a
violation of Florida Statute 316.193. This is classified as a
first-degree misdemeanor based on your two previous DUI convictions from
1991 and 1980.

**Maximum Potential Penalties if Convicted at Trial:**

-   Up to 12 months in county jail

-   Up to 12 months supervised probation

-   Fines: \$2,000 to \$5,000 (plus court costs and fees)

-   A license suspension of 6 months to 1 year

-   90 days of mandatory vehicle impoundment

-   Ignition interlock device installed for a minimum of 2 years

-   Complete the DUI Level 2 school with follow-up treatment

**State's Recent Plea Offer**

The prosecution is offering to amend the charge to a simple DUI with
these conditions:

-   Adjudication of guilt

-   12 months of probation (eligible for early termination after 9
    months if all conditions are complete and you have been attending AA
    twice a month)

-   Pay a \$500 fine

-   Pay costs of court

-   Pay costs of investigation of \$108 to Palm Bay PD

-   Complete the DUI Level 2 school with follow-up treatment as required

-   Complete the Victim Awareness Program/You Impact completion

-   6 months' driver's license revocation

-   50 hours of community service (half eligible for buyout)

-   10 days vehicle impoundment (this involves is putting a boot on your
    vehicle)

This offer provides some benefits, including:

-   Guaranteed no jail time

-   reduced fine (\$500 vs. \$2,000-\$5,000)

-   potential early probation termination, and

-   Reduced vehicle impoundment (10 days vs. 90 days).

This offer treats the case essentially like a regular DUI. Accepting it
would result in your third DUI conviction. This means any future DUI
arrest would likely be charged as a fourth DUI, which is a felony
offense carrying potential prison time.

The disadvantages of accepting this offer involve:

You will still face a license suspension along with other consequences
associated with DUIs. Based on our discussions, this offer does not
address your most significant concerns, particularly regarding your
license suspension. However, you might be immediately eligible to obtain
a hardship license if you have completed DUI school. With the addition
of the interlock device and the increased fine, this is essentially the
same outcome, I believe, you would receive if you went to trial,
although I cannot guarantee that. 

Most importantly, a third DUI conviction means that any future DUI
arrests may be charged as felonies. If you were ever convicted of a
fourth DUI, then you would become a convicted felon, and your driver's
license would be permanently revoked.

**Case Discussion:**

After reviewing the body camera footage and police reports, your case is
defensible. Notably, we can question the validity of the reasons that
led to the initial traffic stop concerning your speed. Furthermore,
there may be significant concerns about the administration of the field
sobriety tests, particularly in relation to your age (71), which could
affect the reliability of those tests. Additionally, the "evidence"
indicating substantial impairment mainly relies on officer observations,
which is not substantiated by the video footage.

On the other hand, there are strengths in the state's case that must be
acknowledged. The officer noted instances of stumbling at the Dog House,
along with your admission of consuming alcohol and some slurred speech
captured on video. While there were minimal observations regarding your
driving pattern, it is important to point out that the officer involved
is also a drug recognition evaluator, which may lend credibility to his
observations.

Given these factors, I believe this case is defensible, though the state
does have evidence it will present. The outcome at trial would depend
significantly on how a jury interprets the officer's observations versus
the potential weaknesses in the evidence.

**Proposed Counter-Offer**

As we discussed, I recommend we counter with an offer to reduce the
charge to reckless driving with enhanced conditions. This would avoid
the DUI conviction while still addressing the state's concerns about
public safety:

**Proposed Counter-Offer Terms:**

-   Amend the charge to Reckless driving instead of DUI, Florida Statute
    316.192.

-   12 months of supervised probation with the option to terminate after
    6 months if all conditions are complete and there are no violations.

-   Pay a \$250 fine

-   Pay court costs, including a \$50 cost of prosecution

-   Pay the cost of investigation to the Palm Bay PD of \$207.98. This
    is essentially a reimbursement for the officer's time

-   Complete 100 hours of community service with the option to buy out
    50 hours at \$10/hour.

-   Install an ignition interlock device for 6 months. This is a device
    installed in your vehicle that requires you to provide a breath
    sample before starting the car.

-   Educational programs:

    -   Complete the DUI School Level 2

    -   Complete the Victim Impact Program/YouImpact Program

    -   Complete the 4 Hour Basic Driver Improvement Class

-   Probation conditions:

    -   No alcohol or drug consumption during probation

    -   Submit to random testing for alcohol and illicit drugs at your
        expense

Additionally, you may want to consider also adding the following
conditions to the offer to incentivize the State to accept the offer:

-   Bi-monthly AA meetings

-   Submitting to a substance abuse evaluation and treatment

-   Make a substantial donation to a charity.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Please confirm that you are rejecting the State's DUI offer.

2.  Please confirm that you approve of me sending the above
    counter-offer to the State.

The choice is ultimately yours, and we want you to make a decision that
truly serves your best interests. If we cannot come to an agreement with
the State, then we will begin litigating these issues with the stop and
arrest, and move this case to trial. I urge you to look over the
information in this email and think about the long-term consequences of
a third DUI conviction. Don't hesitate to contact us with any questions
or concerns.

I am always available to discuss this case and your evidence further.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you need clarification on any aspect of
this matter.
