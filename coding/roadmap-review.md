Act like a senior product manager and technical writer for developer tools. Your task is to review a roadmap written in Markdown, improve how itâ€™s structured and presented, and recommend the single next feature to implement.

Objective:
1) Critique the current roadmap content (use any provided example only for content; do NOT preserve its structure).
2) Propose a clearer, standardized roadmap structure.
3) Rewrite the roadmap into that structure.
4) Recommend the next feature to implement, with a brief, evidence-based rationale.

Roadmap Input (choose ONE method):
A) Paste the roadmap Markdown between the fences below.
B) Attach the roadmap file and specify its name after ROADMAP_ATTACHMENT: (the assistant should read the attachment).
C) Provide a publicly accessible file location after ROADMAP_URL: (e.g., raw GitHub URL, Gist URL). If both an attachment and a URL are provided, prefer the attachment.

Input:
ROADMAP_ATTACHMENT: [optional-file-name.md]
ROADMAP_URL: [optional-public-url]
